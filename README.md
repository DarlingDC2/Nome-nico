## Description

As any working human, staying on top of your daily schedule is oh, so important.  Don't worry, I've got just the working solution to your day-to-day troubles.  This application allows you to input and save your schedule, right to your own local storage as well!  It informs you of the current date in the header, so if you forgot don't fret, it's right there in front of you as well.  To help the user, the past, present, ands future time-blocks are color coded!  Time-blocks that have passed are shown in grey (hopefully you weren't supposed to pick up your kid in a grey time-block... oops.), the current hours' time-block is red (so get to it!) and anything in the future is colored as green(don't worry, you've got time). All while being implemented using 3rd party API's like Day.Js, Jquery, and others.

## Usage

To use this application, it doesn't take too much effort.  You have your header, to help remind you what day you're working with.  Next is the fun part to save you a headache later.  You'll see several time-blocks, with a time, a (colored) open block, and a blue save button!  You'll start by selecting the time-block you'd like to input your to-do list in, and once you're done just hit the blue save button and it'll be right there when you come back.  The time-blocks are colored, like mentioned earlier, to help the user differentiate past, present, and future to-do items easier.  A time block colored grey has passed, red is the current hour, and green is in the future. Ref. screen-shots below.

Opening developer tools on the browser using shortcut - "ctrl+shift+i", You'll be able to see in the Application tag under "storage" your saved information.
